## HTTP Response Codes

Nimble's residential proxy returns standard HTTP response codes along with proxy-specific codes to help you understand request status and troubleshoot issues.

## Success Codes

<ResponseField name="200" type="Success">
  Request completed successfully
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="302" type="Redirect">
  Target server sent a redirect response
</ResponseField>

## Client Error Codes

### 400 - Bad Request

**Meaning**: The request is badly formatted.

**Common Causes**:

- Missing account name, pipeline name, or password
- Incorrect connection string format
- Missing target URL

**Solution**:

```bash
# Verify your connection string format
http://account-{accountName}-pipeline-{pipelineName}:{password}@ip.nimbleway.com:7000
```

---

### 401 - Unauthorized

**Meaning**: The target website rejected your authentication credentials.

**Common Causes**:

- Target site requires login credentials
- Session expired on target site
- Invalid credentials for target site

**Solution**:

- Verify you're providing correct credentials for the target website
- This is different from proxy authentication (407)

---

### 402 - Payment Required

**Meaning**: Your trial quota or account credits have been exhausted.

**Solution**:

- Check your account balance in the Nimble dashboard
- Contact your account executive to add credits or increase quota
- Upgrade your plan if needed

---

### 403 - Forbidden

**Meaning**: The request cannot be fulfilled.

**Common Causes**:

- Pipeline is disabled
- Target site is on Nimble's forbidden list
- Account suspended

**Solution**:

- Check pipeline status in dashboard
- Verify target URL is not restricted
- Contact your account manager for details

---

### 404 - Not Found

**Meaning**: The requested resource was not found.

**Common Causes**:

- Incorrect target URL
- Page doesn't exist on target site
- Typo in URL

**Solution**:

```bash
# Verify the target URL is correct
curl -x http://account-accountName-pipeline-pipelineName:password@ip.nimbleway.com:7000 \
  https://correct-url.com/path
```

---

### 407 - Proxy Authentication Required

**Meaning**: Proxy authentication failed.

**Common Causes**:

- Incorrect account name
- Wrong pipeline name
- Invalid pipeline password
- IP not in allowlist (for IP authentication)

**Solution**:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Check Credentials
# Verify your proxy credentials
account name: your-company
pipeline name: residential
password: your-pipeline-password
```


```bash Test Connection
# Test with correct credentials
curl -x http://account-yourcompany-pipeline-residential:password@ip.nimbleway.com:7000 \
  https://ipinfo.io
```

</CodeGroup>

## Server Error Codes

### 500 - Internal Proxy Server Error

**Meaning**: Internal error occurred in Nimble's proxy infrastructure.

**Solution**:

- Retry the request
- If issue persists, contact Nimble support
- Check status page for known issues

---

### 502 - Bad Gateway

**Meaning**: The target server returned an invalid response.

**Common Causes**:

- Target website is down or misconfigured
- Target server returned malformed response

**Solution**:

- Verify target website is accessible
- Try a different target to confirm proxy is working
- Retry after a delay

---

### 503 - Service Unavailable

**Meaning**: Proxy service is temporarily overloaded.

**Solution**:

- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Contact support if consistently experiencing 503 errors
- Check status page for service disruptions

---

### 504 - Gateway Timeout

**Meaning**: The target website didn't respond within the timeout period.

**Common Causes**:

- Target website is slow or unresponsive
- Network connectivity issues
- Server overload on target site

**Solution**:

- Increase request timeout in your client
- Retry the request
- Try targeting a different page to verify proxy connectivity

## Proxy-Specific Codes

### 522 - Connect Timeout

**Meaning**: Connection to proxy timed out during the CONNECT phase.

**Common Causes**:

- Network connectivity issues between client and proxy
- Firewall blocking connection
- DNS resolution issues

**Solution**:

- Check your network connection
- Verify firewall allows connections to ip.nimbleway.com:7000
- Test basic connectivity: `ping ip.nimbleway.com`

---

### 525 - No IP Found

**Meaning**: No suitable IP could be matched for your request parameters.

**Common Causes**:

- Requested location has no available IPs
- Too specific geotargeting parameters
- No IPs available in specified city/state

**Solution**:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Broaden Target
# If city targeting fails, try state or country only
# Instead of:
-country-US-state-WY-city-cheyenne

# Try:
-country-US-state-WY
```


```bash Check Availability
# Verify location availability via Admin API
GET /location/cities
```
