## Overview

Managed Web Search Agents (WSA) are production-ready, fully maintained data extraction solutions operated by Nimble. This guide covers the integration requirements and service standards that apply across all Managed WSA products.

**What's included:**
- Fully managed infrastructure and execution
- 24/7 monitoring and issue resolution
- SLA-backed data delivery
- Schema and logic updates handled by Nimble

## Integration Guide

### Input Configuration

#### S3 Path Structure

Input files should be delivered to your designated S3 bucket using the following path convention:

```
s3://<bucket-name>/input/<agent-name>/dt=YYYY-MM-DD/<filename>.<ext>
```

**Example:**
```
s3://nimble-customer-data/input/product-search/dt=2026-01-13/products.csv
```

#### AWS Role Provisioning

To enable Nimble to read from your input bucket:

1. Create an IAM role with read permissions for your input S3 path
2. Add Nimble's AWS account as a trusted entity (provided during onboarding)
3. Share the role ARN with your Nimble account team

#### Supported Input Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| CSV | `.csv` | UTF-8 encoded, header row required |
| Parquet | `.parquet` | Preferred for large datasets |
| JSON Lines | `.jsonl` | One JSON object per line |

#### Input File Requirements

- Files must include all required fields as specified in your agent's input schema
- Maximum file size: 1GB per file (split larger datasets)
- Empty files are ignored; include at least one valid record

### Output Configuration

#### S3 Path Structure

Output files are delivered to your designated bucket with hourly partitioning:

```
s3://<bucket-name>/output/<agent-name>/dt=YYYY-MM-DD/hr=HH/<filename>.<ext>
```

**Example:**
```
s3://nimble-customer-data/output/product-search/dt=2026-01-13/hr=14/results_001.parquet
```

#### Supported Output Formats

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Parquet | `.parquet` | Analytics, data warehouses |
| CSV | `.csv` | Spreadsheet tools, simple integrations |
| JSON Lines | `.jsonl` | Streaming, API integrations |

Default format is Parquet. Contact your account team to configure an alternative.

#### File Naming Convention

Output files follow this naming pattern:
```
<agent-name>_<batch-id>_<sequence>.<ext>
```

## Scheduling & Cadence

### Standard Cadence

All Managed WSA products run on a **daily cadence** by default. Execution begins at your configured start time (UTC) and processes all input files from the previous partition.

### Custom Cadence

Custom scheduling options are available as an add-on:
- Hourly
- Multiple times per day
- Weekly
- Custom intervals

Contact your account team to configure custom cadence.

### Execution Time

- Default execution time: **06:00 UTC**
- Configure your preferred execution window during onboarding
- All times are in UTC

## Service Level Agreement

### Data Retention & Recovery

- **Output retention:** 7 days in delivery bucket
- **Backup window:** 7-day rolling backup for recovery requests
- **Re-delivery:** Available upon request within retention window

### Coverage Commitments

SLA commitments apply to:
- ✅ Process initiation at scheduled time
- ✅ Infrastructure availability
- ✅ Issue response time

SLA does not cover:
- ❌ Target website availability or blocking
- ❌ Input data quality issues
- ❌ Customer-side S3 access problems

## Authentication & Access

### IAM Role Configuration

Nimble requires cross-account IAM roles for S3 access:

**Input bucket (your account → Nimble reads):**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<your-input-bucket>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<your-input-bucket>/input/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output bucket (Nimble writes → your account):**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<your-output-bucket>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<your-output-bucket>/output/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Access Provisioning Process

1. **Onboarding:** Nimble provides AWS account ID and external ID
2. **Role creation:** You create IAM roles with required permissions
3. **Validation:** Nimble validates access and confirms setup
4. **Production:** Agent begins processing on agreed schedule

## Change Management & Support

### Schema & Logic Changes

To request changes to your agent:

1. Submit a change request via your account team or support channel
2. Nimble reviews feasibility and impact (1-2 business days)
3. Changes are tested in staging environment
4. Scheduled deployment with 48-hour advance notice

**Change types:**
- Input schema modifications
- Output field additions
- Extraction logic updates
- Target URL changes

### Support Channels

| Channel | Response Time | Use For |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Email | 24 hours | General inquiries, change requests |
| Slack (if configured) | 4 hours | Urgent issues, delivery questions |
| Emergency hotline | 1 hour | Production outages, SLA breaches |

Contact your account team for channel configuration.
