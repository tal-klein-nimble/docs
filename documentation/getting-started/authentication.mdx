</Note>

Create and manage API keys programmatically using the Nimble API.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Coming soon
from nimble import Nimble

nimble = Nimble(api_key="YOUR-MASTER-KEY")

# Create new API key
result = nimble.create_api_key({
    "name": "Production Server"
})

print(result["api_key"])
```


```node Node.js
// Coming soon
import { Nimble } from "@nimbleway/sdk";

const nimble = new Nimble({ apiKey: "YOUR-MASTER-KEY" });

// Create new API key
const result = await nimble.createApiKey({
  name: "Production Server"
});

console.log(result.apiKey);
```


```bash cURL
# Coming soon
curl -X POST 'https://api.nimbleway.io/v1/api-keys' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-MASTER-KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Production Server"
}'
```
